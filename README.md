# Course Enrollment Platform API

A secure, database-backed RESTful API built with FastAPI for managing a course enrollment platform. Implements JWT authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), PostgreSQL with async SQLAlchemy, Redis rate limiting, and comprehensive automated tests.

---

## Tech Stack

- **FastAPI** — web framework
- **PostgreSQL** — relational database
- **SQLAlchemy (async)** — ORM
- **Alembic** — database migrations
- **Redis** — rate limiting
- **JWT** — authentication
- **Docker** — containerisation
- **pytest** — automated testing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/AbdullahiAtaurrahman/capstone_project.git>
cd CAPSTONE_PROJECT
```

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Start the Application

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

API will be available at: `http://localhost:8000`

Interactive docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### Run Locally with Uvicorn

If you want to start the app directly on your local machine without Docker, install dependencies into your virtual environment and run:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Then open:

- `http://localhost:8000`
- `http://localhost:8000/docs`

---

## Running Migrations

```bash
docker compose exec api alembic upgrade head
```

To create a new migration after model changes:

```bash
docker compose exec api alembic revision --autogenerate -m "your message"
docker compose exec api alembic upgrade head
```

---

## Running Tests

Tests run against a separate `capstone_project_test` database. Create it first:

```bash
docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE capstone_project_test;"
```

Then run the test suite:

```bash
docker compose exec api pytest tests/ -v
```

> **Note:** Tests use a dedicated test database and do not affect your main database.
